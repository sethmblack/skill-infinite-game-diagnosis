# Infinite Game Diagnosis

Diagnose whether an individual or organization is applying finite thinking to an infinite game and recommend mindset shifts for long-term success.

**Token Budget:** ~800 tokens. Reserve tokens for analysis output.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Encourage abandoning ethical responsibilities in the name of "long-term thinking"
- Dismiss legitimate competitive concerns as merely "finite thinking"
- Help organizations avoid accountability by reframing failures as "playing the infinite game"

**Infinite thinking is not:** An excuse for poor performance, ignoring market realities, or endless patience with dysfunction.

---

## When to Use

- User uses "beat the competition," "win market share," or "be number one" language
- Organization is obsessed with rankings, comparisons, or "winning"
- Short-term thinking is undermining long-term sustainability
- Strategic decisions prioritize quarterly results over lasting impact
- User is exhausted from constant competitive warfare
- Discussion of strategy, vision, or competitive positioning

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **situation** | Yes | The strategic challenge, competitive situation, or decision being faced |
| **current_language** | No | Specific language being used (goals, metrics, competitive framing) |
| **success_metrics** | No | How success is currently being measured |
| **just_cause** | No | The organization's purpose or vision (if articulated) |

---

## Finite vs. Infinite Games

### Finite Game Characteristics

| Attribute | Finite Game |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Players** | Known and agreed upon |
| **Rules** | Fixed and agreed upon |
| **Objective** | Clear endpoint; winner declared |
| **Timeframe** | Defined beginning and end |
| **Success** | Beating opponents |
| **Examples** | Football, chess, elections |

### Infinite Game Characteristics

| Attribute | Infinite Game |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Players** | Known and unknown; players come and go |
| **Rules** | Changeable; players can change how they play |
| **Objective** | Keep playing; perpetuate the game |
| **Timeframe** | No end; no finish line |
| **Success** | Outlasting, improving, advancing a cause |
| **Examples** | Business, politics, life, careers, relationships |

### The Problem

**When finite players play infinite games:**
- They optimize for wins that don't matter
- Short-term gains undermine long-term viability
- They exhaust resources trying to "win" an unwinnable game
- They eventually drop out of the game entirely

**Key insight:** "There is no winning in business. Business is an infinite game."

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Classify the Game

Determine if the situation is actually a finite or infinite game:

**Finite Game Indicators:**
- Clear endpoint (project deadline, election, tournament)
- Known competitors with agreed rules
- Winner will be declared
- Playing again requires starting over

**Infinite Game Indicators:**
- No natural endpoint
- New players can enter anytime
- Rules can change
- "Winning" doesn't end the game
- Success is continuing to play

### Step 2: Identify Finite Language

Scan for finite language patterns that reveal finite mindset in infinite game:

| Finite Language | Problem | Infinite Reframe |
|----------------|---------|------------------|
| "Beat the competition" | You can't beat someone at a game with no end | "Outlast the competition" |
| "Win market share" | Share fluctuates; no permanent win | "Earn loyal customers" |
| "Be number one" | Rankings change constantly | "Be better than yesterday" |
| "Dominate the market" | Invites retaliation and exhaustion | "Serve our audience deeply" |
| "Crush them" | Creates finite war, not infinite play | "Inspire them to improve" |
| "Final push" | There is no final anything | "Sustainable excellence" |

### Step 3: Assess Against Five Practices

Evaluate the organization against the five practices of infinite-minded leadership:

| Practice | Question | Assessment |
|----------|----------|------------|
| **Just Cause** | Is there a vision of a future worth sacrificing for? | Strong / Weak / Missing |
| **Trusting Teams** | Do people feel safe to be vulnerable? | Strong / Weak / Missing |
| **Worthy Rivals** | Are competitors seen as teachers or enemies? | Strong / Weak / Missing |
| **Existential Flexibility** | Can the organization pivot dramatically to advance the cause? | Strong / Weak / Missing |
| **Courage to Lead** | Are leaders taking long-term risks despite short-term pressure? | Strong / Weak / Missing |

### Step 4: Diagnose the Cost

What is the finite mindset costing?

**Common costs:**
- Exhaustion (racing that never ends)
- Short-term decisions that mortgage the future
- Talent loss (people leave finite-feeling cultures)
- Innovation stagnation (playing not to lose)
- Ethical compromises to "win"
- Loss of purpose (why are we doing this?)

### Step 5: Recommend Mindset Shifts

Provide specific recommendations for shifting from finite to infinite:

**Language shifts:**
- Change how goals are articulated
- Reframe success metrics
- Rename competitors as "worthy rivals"

**Structural shifts:**
- Articulate a Just Cause
- Build psychological safety
- Create long-term thinking forums

**Metric shifts:**
- Add long-term health metrics
- Measure loyalty, not just acquisition
- Track capability building, not just output

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Situation is genuinely finite | Acknowledge it's a finite game; finite strategy is appropriate |
| User is in crisis | Infinite thinking doesn't mean ignoring urgent threats; address immediate needs |
| No Just Cause exists | Flag as critical gap; infinite play requires a cause worth advancing |
| Finite thinking is working short-term | Acknowledge it may work now; highlight the inevitable costs |
| User wants to "destroy" competitors | Explain this exhausts both players; worthy rivals make you better |

```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:**
"Our competitor just launched a similar product at a lower price. We need to crush them before they steal our market share. What's our strategy to win?"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Infinite Game Diagnosis

### Game Classification
**Type:** Infinite
**Evidence:** Business has no endpoint. Your competitor launching doesn't end the game. Market share fluctuates indefinitely. New competitors will emerge. There's no trophy ceremony where you "win" the market.

### Finite Language Detected
| Pattern | Instance | Reframe |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Beat/Crush | "crush them" | "outlast them" or "learn from them" |
| Win | "strategy to win" | "strategy to keep playing" |
| Steal | "steal our market share" | "earn customers we've neglected" |

### Five Practices Assessment
| Practice | Status | Evidence |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Just Cause | Unclear | No mention of why you exist beyond competing |
| Trusting Teams | Unknown | Not addressed in situation |
| Worthy Rivals | Weak | Competitor framed as enemy to crush, not teacher |
| Existential Flexibility | Unknown | Not addressed |
| Courage to Lead | At Risk | Price pressure may force short-term compromises |

### Cost of Finite Mindset

Trying to "crush" a competitor in an infinite game leads to:
- **Price wars** that erode margins for everyone
- **Exhaustion** from a race with no finish line
- **Lost focus** on serving customers in favor of attacking competitors
- **Potential ethical compromises** to "win" at any cost

You might win this battle and lose your ability to keep playing.

### Recommendations

**Immediate (Language):**
- Stop using "win/lose" language internally
- Rename this competitor as a "worthy rival" - what do they do well that exposes your weaknesses?

**Near-term (Structure):**
- Clarify your Just Cause: Why do you exist beyond competing? If you disappeared tomorrow, why would anyone miss you?
- Differentiate on Why, not What: They can match your price and features. They can't match your purpose.

**Long-term (Culture):**
- Build a culture focused on advancing your cause, not beating anyone
- Measure customer loyalty and lifetime value, not just market share

### The Infinite Reframe

**Current Frame:** "They attacked us. We need to defend our territory and destroy them before they win."

**Infinite Frame:** "A new player entered our infinite game. They've revealed where we've become complacent. We'll learn from what they do well, double down on our purpose, and serve our customers so deeply they wouldn't dream of leaving. We'll still be here when this competitor exhausts themselves trying to win an unwinnable game."

## Integration

This skill is derived from Simon Sinek's *The Infinite Game*. When invoked by the simon-sinek expert, apply Sinek's voice: optimistic, long-term focused, grounded in purpose rather than competition.
